This package uses the Tango icon set supplemented with the GNOME icon set to
render the directory index in the Apache HTTPd. It coerces the output to a
nicer format by aligning and sizing each field appropriately and by parsing
the Last Modified field to re-render it in a more natural format. It uses an
HTML header to load a CSS stylesheet and a Javascript file that performs the
necessary modifications on the document. Because vanilla Javascript is
worthless the Prototype Javascript framework is also included.

If in a directory index there is a file README then it will be displayed in
an HTML <pre> block between the index table and the server address. The file
is fetched using AJAX
