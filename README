This package uses the Tango icon set supplemented with the GNOME icon set to
render the directory index in the Apache HTTPd. It coerces the output to a
nicer format by aligning and sizing each field appropriately and by parsing
the Last Modified field to re-rendering it in a more natural format. It uses
an HTML header to load a CSS stylesheet and a Javascript file that performs
the necessary modifications on the document. Because vanilla Javascript is
worthless the Prototype Javascript framework is also included.

Installation Instruction:
